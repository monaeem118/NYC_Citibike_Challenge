### Suggestion for Additional Visualizations
Following suggestions can be made for additional visualizations to get further insight into the data:

- One visualization can be done based on "Trips by Age Group" so that we can target the customers based on their age and make sure adequate number of bikes are availble during those hours.

- Another visualization can be made based on "Trips by Age Group per Hour" which would tell us which age group are mostly using the bikes on hourly basis.
